# Mandelbrot-Distribution-Function

This repository aims to provide a starting point for those who wish to implement their own dpqr functions - well, based on my own experience! I will point out the basic few things one needs to note and achieve for the basic design. The final implementation of the Mandelbrot(dpqr) at the bottom will follow the style/convention of those done in the VGAM R package. 

The design of different PDF(PMF) & CDF functions can be generally outlined the same way, while some others (particularly the quantile function) is more distribution-specific - by saying which, I mean you'll usually need to chose from different methods to desgin the function according to the nature of the distribution itself. To see the basic usage of dpqr functions please refer to my other repository [R--dpqr-functions](https://github.com/mijchou/R--dpqr-functions).
