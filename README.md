You may have overseen the functions dnorm, pnorm, qnorm & rnorm in R. They all seem to be associated with the normal distribution in some ways... but what exactly do they actually do & how do they all differ to each others? In this repository I will make a short explanation of the basic dpqr functions - with illustrations of the normal distribution.


## Implementation Details

## Testings



# Mandelbrot-Distribution-Function

Implementation of dpqr-functions of the Zipf distribution derived by Mandelbrot (1961).
